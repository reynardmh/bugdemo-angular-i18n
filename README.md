# BugdemoAngularI18n

```
$ npm install
$ ng serve
```

You should be able to build and run the app on `http://localhost:4200/`

There is a `CoolComponent` that is imported from another npm package `https://github.com/reynardmh/angular2-component-module`

However, running ng-xi18n will cause error

```
$ ./node_modules/.bin/ng-xi18n

Error: Unexpected value 'CoolComponent' declared by the module 'AppModule'
```
